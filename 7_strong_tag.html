<!-- Strong Tag in HTML (<strong>...</strong>) -->

<!--
The <strong> tag makes text bold and gives it semantic importance.
Indicates that the text is important or has strong emphasis.
Browsers display it in bold, but its real purpose is semantic (screen readers read it as "important").
Comes in opening <strong> and closing </strong> tags.
