<!-- Emphasis Tag in HTML (<em>...</em>) -->

<!--
The <em> tag emphasizes text.
Browsers usually display it in italic, but it also gives semantic meaning (important/emphasized words).
Screen readers read it with stress/importance, unlike <i> which is just visual styling.
Comes in opening <em> and closing </em> tags.
