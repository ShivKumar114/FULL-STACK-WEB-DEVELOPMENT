<!-- Preformatted Text Tag in HTML (<pre>...</pre>) -->

<!--
The <pre> tag displays text exactly as written in the HTML code.
Preserves spaces, line breaks, and tabs unlike normal paragraphs.
Useful for code snippets, poetry, ASCII art, or any text requiring exact formatting.
Comes in opening <pre> and closing </pre> tags.
